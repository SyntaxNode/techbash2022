# Practical Guide To Go

**Speaker:** Scott Kay

Go (aka GoLang) is a powerful open source programming language featuring simple syntax, fast compilation, and first class concurrency. Originally created at Google, Go has reached maturity and is now widely used across the industry - especially in the most popular infrastructure services such as Docker, Kubernetes, CoreDNS, and HashiCorp products including Terraform, Consul, and Vault.

In this session, you'll learn how to get started in the Go ecosystem, see highlights of the best parts of Go code, and I'll point out areas that I've personally found confusing - along with the solutions I found.
